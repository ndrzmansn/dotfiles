Note that the example is just an example; the paper is\nfrom last year.\n\n\n1.  Use latex.\n\nCopy aec-badge.pdf into your paper directory and insert the following\nfragment in your paper preamble.  You can change the vertical\nplacement of the stamp by adjusting the '3.5in' in the \\raisebox as\nnecessary.\n\n\\usepackage[firstpage]{draftwatermark}\n\\SetWatermarkText{\\hspace*{8in}\\raisebox{3.5in}{\\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{aec-badge}}}\n\\SetWatermarkAngle{0}\n\n\n2.  Use freely available pdftk\n\nEnsure you have pdftk (http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/).\n\nThe following command will make a version of your paper with the\nbadge.  By choosing a different version of the background (replace the\n'a' in the filename with another letter 'b' ... 'e') you'll get the\nbadge located at slightly different points.  Choose the one that works\nfor you.\n\n% pdftk paper.pdf multibackground aec-badge-a.pdf output paper-badge.pdf dont_ask\n\n\n3.  Use Acrobat Pro  (tested on Version 9)\n\nLoad your document and then use the Document -> Watermark -> Add... menu.\n\na.
